## Drakali 🧛
This is my final rice, probably for a while. Now, obviously, "omg hacker 1337 OS!!!" 
This is a stupid project and I should be publicly humilated for ricing an OS like Kali but at least now I can die peacefully knowing that I've done something literally so profoundly useless. It's also virtualized so don't worry about me running an insecure OS on bare-metal. 

Most, if not, all of the colours used, came directly from the official dracula theme website:
