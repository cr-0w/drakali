## Drakali üßõüê≤
This is my final rice, probably for a while. Now, obviously, "_omg 1337 hacker OS!!!_"
This is a stupid project and besides the wonderful nature of BSPWM and how well it works with penetration testing-based multi-tasking, this project serves no other purpose other than making Kali look and feel better. I should be publicly humiliated for ricing an OS like Kali but at least now I can die peacefully knowing that I've done something so profoundly and utterly useless. Kidding, of course. I'm proud of it nonetheless.

Most, if not, all of the colours used came directly from the [official Dracula theme website](https://draculatheme.com/). Also, suprisingly enough, compared to my other two rices, this rice doesn't have that many configs for it. It's mainly just a colourscheme extravaganza. However, should I end up including other things like Dunst, Ranger, etc. to the rice, I'll include it in the repository as well.
