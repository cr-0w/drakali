## Drakali üßõüê≤
This is my final rice, probably for a while. Now, obviously, "omg hacker 1337 OS!!!" 
This is a stupid project and I should be publicly humilated for ricing an OS like Kali but at least now I can die peacefully knowing that I've done something literally so profoundly useless. It's also virtualized so don't worry about me running an insecure OS on bare-metal. 

Most, if not, all of the colours used, came directly from the official dracula theme website:

## Ricing Shebang
*OS: KALI*</br>
*WM: BSPWM*</br>
*SHELL: ZSH*</br>
*TERMINAL: KITTY</br> 
>! (Normally, I'd use alacritty, but it was completely broken on this system and I was too lazy to fix it so, you can easily swap out kitty w/ alacritty)*</br>
*EDITOR: NEOVIM*</br>
*LAUNCHER: ROFI*</br>
